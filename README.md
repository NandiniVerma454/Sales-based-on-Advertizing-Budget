Predicting Sales via Advertising Budget

ðŸš€ Project Description

It is a data science web app that allows users to predict product sales based on advertising budgets allocated across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper).

ðŸš€ Key features:

â€¢	Trained a regression model (Decision Tree Regressor) on an advertising dataset.
â€¢	Built an interactive web app using Streamlit to input budgets and predict sales.
â€¢	Deployed the app on Streamlit Cloud, making it accessible via a web browser.

ðŸš€ Tech stack:

â€¢	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib)
â€¢	Streamlit for web app UI
â€¢	GitHub + Streamlit Cloud for deployment

ðŸš€ Machine Learning Model

- Model type: Decision Tree Regressor
- Training: The model was trained on a standard Advertising dataset (features: TV, Radio, Newspaper; target: Sales).
- Persistence: The model is saved as `sales_model.pkl` using `joblib` for easy loading in the app.
  
ðŸš€ Overview

  In this app, you can:
- Input TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising budgets.
- Get instant predictions of sales based on these budgets.
- Visualize and interact with a clean, user-friendly interface.
